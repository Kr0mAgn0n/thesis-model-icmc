  abstract  = {In this chapter, for the first time, we introduce geometry into smooth manifold theory. To define geometric concepts such as lengths and angles on a smooth manifold, we introduce a structure called a Riemannian metric, which is a choice of inner product on each tangent space, varying smoothly from point to point. After defining Riemannian metrics and the main constructions associated with them, we show how submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds inherit induced Riemannian metrics. Then we show how a Riemannian metric leads to a distance function, which allows us to consider connected Riemannian manifolds as metric spaces.},

  abstract  = {Before we can define curvature on Riemannian manifolds, we need to study geodesies, the Riemannian generalizations of straight lines. It is tempting to define geodesies as curves that minimize length, at least between nearby points. However, this property turns out to be technically difficult to work with as a definition, so instead we'll choose a different property of straight lines and generalize that.},
