  abstract  = {In this chapter, for the first time, we introduce geometry into smooth manifold theory. To define geometric concepts such as lengths and angles on a smooth manifold, we introduce a structure called a Riemannian metric, which is a choice of inner product on each tangent space, varying smoothly from point to point. After defining Riemannian metrics and the main constructions associated with them, we show how submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds inherit induced Riemannian metrics. Then we show how a Riemannian metric leads to a distance function, which allows us to consider connected Riemannian manifolds as metric spaces.},

  abstract  = {Before we can define curvature on Riemannian manifolds, we need to study geodesies, the Riemannian generalizations of straight lines. It is tempting to define geodesies as curves that minimize length, at least between nearby points. However, this property turns out to be technically difficult to work with as a definition, so instead we'll choose a different property of straight lines and generalize that.},

  abstract  = {In this chapter, we begin our study of the local invariants of Riemann-ian metrics. Starting with the question of whether all Riemannian metrics are locally isometric, we are led to a definition of the Riemannian curvature tensor as a measure of the failure of second covariant derivatives to commute. Then we prove the main result of this chapter: A manifold has zero curvature if and only if it is flat, that is, locally isometric to Euclidean space. At the end of the chapter, we derive the basic symmetries of the curvature tensor, and introduce the Ricci and scalar curvatures. The results of this chapter apply essentially unchanged to pseudo-Riemannian metrics.},

  abstract = {In this survey, we discuss various aspects of the minimal surface equation in the three-sphere {\$}{\$}S^3{\$}{\$}. After recalling the basic definitions, we describe a family of immersed minimal tori with rotational symmetry. We then review the known examples of embedded minimal surfaces in {\$}{\$}S^3{\$}{\$}. Besides the equator and the Clifford torus, these include the Lawson and Kapouleas-Yang examples, as well as a new family of examples found recently by Choe and Soret. We next discuss uniqueness theorems for minimal surfaces in {\$}{\$}S^3{\$}{\$}, such as the work of Almgren on the genus {\$}{\$}0{\$}{\$}case, and our recent solution of Lawson's conjecture for embedded minimal surfaces of genus {\$}{\$}1{\$}{\$}. More generally, we show that any minimal surface of genus {\$}{\$}1{\$}{\$}which is Alexandrov immersed must be rotationally symmetric. We also discuss Urbano's estimate for the Morse index of an embedded minimal surface and give an outline of the recent proof of the Willmore conjecture by Marques and Neves. Finally, we describe estimates for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a minimal surface.},
